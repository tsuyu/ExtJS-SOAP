This is a sample application that shows how to communicate to SOAP web services from Ext JS.

Setup
The example uses ColdFusion 10 as the backend server.  You can download a free trial from www.adobe.com.  Once installed you can place this folder on the server within the ColdFusion context.

The code also assumes that Ext JS is installed in the webroot as /extjs.

The default endpoint in the SOAP store is to use /cfusion/samples/People.cfc, you can modify this to wherever you get the folder installed.

When running the app, it will read data into a grid, and you can either add new records with the plus button in the top right or double click a row to bring up an edit and delete window.  The data is only persisted for the immediate session and reset on the next page load.

Enjoy!
